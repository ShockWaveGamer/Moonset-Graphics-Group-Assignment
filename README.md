[Backup Of The Standard RP Shaders We Wrote](https://github.com/ShockWaveGamer/Group-Assignment-Back-Up.git)
Unfortunatly we were unable to port the individual assignment shaders from SRP to URP. This is a backup project featuring them.

# Statement of Contributions

- [x] Individual Assignment Shaders (Secondary Project)

## Daniel Fiuk:

- [x] Decal Shader  (Assets/Shaders/DanielsGroupAssignmentShaders/Decals)
- [x] Fog Post Process (Assets/Shaders/DanielsGroupAssignmentShaders/Fog)

note: our post-processing effects use an external package called Blit Material Feature to work. All this does in our case is restore a feature removed in URP called Custom Post-Process [Cyanilux/URP_BlitRenderFeature](https://github.com/Cyanilux/URP_BlitRenderFeature)
